## Satellite Images to Locate Drones

**Year:** 2023 
**Objective:** Create a 100% autonomous global positioning system capable of locating a drone using satellite images, even when GPS signals are unavailable.

---

### Mission

The project aims to design an advanced autonomous system that leverages satellite imagery to identify and track drones. This system will enable accurate positioning in GPS-deprived environments by integrating multi-modal data and state-of-the-art algorithms.
