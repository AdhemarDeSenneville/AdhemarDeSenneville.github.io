### Mission

The challenge? Build a fully functional drone in **24 hours** during the European Defense Tech Hackathon.  

Our project, the **Anti-Helicopter Aerial Mine**, earned **3rd place** out of 34 participating teams.  
In just one day and night, we successfully fast-prototyped three core technologies:  
- **Audio Position Estimation of Helicopters:** Leveraging deep learning for precise detection.  
- **Tail-Sitter Drone:** Designed for high-speed aerial performance.  
- **Optical Tracking and Guidance Module:** For accurate real-time tracking.
