## Projet FantaBot

**Year:** 2021â€“2022  
**Objective:** Develop a cryptocurrency trading bot with advanced decision-making algorithms.  

---

### Mission

FantaBot is a cryptocurrency trading bot that I created with two friends. I developed the heart of the program: the **decision-making algorithm**.  

- The bot employs a **genetic algorithm** based on graphical, human, and fundamental analysis indices.  
- It was my first experience in processing a large volume of data (several dozen gigabytes) and exploring data science concepts.

### Skills Acquired

- **GitHub:** Teamwork on a large project.  
- **APIs:** Data scraping and real-time interaction with multiple APIs.  
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Implemented the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) method for decision-making.
