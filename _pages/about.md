**Looking for a Ph.D. in Robotics and Machine Learning...**

I am a student in Aeronautical Engineering and Machine Learning, specializing in drone design and programming. I conducted pre-doctoral research in the Image team of [Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/traitement-dimages) at ENS Paris-Saclay. My research project focused on few-shot learning methods for drone and satellite imagery. Prior to this, I completed my end-of-studies internship at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](/projects/int_nasa) and received the [MVA Master's degree](/projects/edu_mva) in 2024.

As Vice President of the SIERA student society focused on drones, I am passionate about participating in drone programming competitions that apply Machine Learning algorithms to real-world challenges. Notable competitions include the [Dassault Challenge](/projects/siera_dassault), [Safran Challenge](/projects/siera_droneload), [EDTH Hackathon](/projects/siera_hackaton_1), and [ISAE Challenge](/projects/siera_racing).

My CV is available <a href="./assets/pdf/CV.pdf">here</a>.
